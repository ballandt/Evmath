## Issues

If you notice something mentionable about avmath do not hesitate to
create an issue even when you are not sure if your problem is already
known. You can use a template to create your issue.

There are three issue templates to contribute issues:

* Bug: Report bugs in the code
* Feature request: Present ideas for new features
* Question: You have a serious question about the code

### General style guide

* Give the issue a title that breaks down the content to a maximum of five words.
* If you use complicated mathematical content it is preferred to use latex syntax.
* If you deal with complicated mathematical content it accelerates the process if you give a link to a source proving what you say.

### Bugs

If you find a bug in the software do a short research if an issue 
corresponding to your bug has already been opened. If you do not find one,
create a new issue following the template. Give it a clear title (which
keywords did you use in your research?). It is not recommended typing
the full path to your problem in the title (ex.: don't: `analysis.Function.newton_method` 
bug ...; do: Function newton_method bug ...) Add the entire path in the text.
If you have an idea to fix this problem be sure to write it down.

### Feature

If you have an idea for a new feature for avmath you can open a feature issue.
The more precise you formulate your idea the more probably it can be implemented.
You can add real or pseudocode to the text.

### Questions

If you want to contribute to the project, but do not understand the meaning
of an essential part of code you can ask via this format.

## Pull requests

If you want to work on an issue on your own follow these steps:

* Create an issue describing the reason of your improvement
* Fork the project
* Create a new branch with the name `issue-#xxx` where xxx is the number of the issue you are working on
* Implement your improvement **only** on this branch
* __Test__ your improvement
* Create a pull request
  * Describe what you have done
  * Show potential weaknesses

Note that is it not sure if your request will be accepted. Either ways
thank you for your engagement.
