## 3.2.0

Planned for 2022-04-01
Version 3.2 is planned to implement more advanced linear algebra features and more number objects

| Feature                                  | Status        | Merge status                     | Comments                   |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Eigenvalues                              | Finished      | successfully merged to `main`    |                            |
| Eigenvectors                             | Pending       | merged to `main`                 | Depends on SLE             |
| SLE under-determined solution            | Testing       | developed in `sles` branch       |                            |
| `root` object                            | Not yet begun | -                                | Will maybe be cancelled    |
| Polynomial                               | Developing    | developed in `polynomial` branch |                            |
| nth grade differentiation for `Function` | Not yet begun | -                                | Will probably be cancelled |
| Fast determinant                         | Finished      | successfully merged to `main`    | Complications during merge |
